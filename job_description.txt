Rehearsals is backed by a16z, 25madison, Factorial, and notable angels from DeepMind and OpenAI including Logan Kilpatrick. The founding team is ex-DeepMind, Databricks, and Google Labs. 



We have founded acquired companies (x2), led Gemini computer-use and tool-use, built Google Lens, post-trained SOTA coding models, and been awarded 25+ patents between us. Our customers include F50 public companies, unicorn tech startups and household name B2C products.


We’re building on the bleeding edge of AI, simulating human preference and actions via our revealed preference engine. We’re already working with category leaders, from hospitality to AI startups, to tell them what their customers want in minutes.


You will be part of the founding team and build your life's work. We focus on core pillars of ownership, agency, craft, and conscientiousness in everyone that we hire.

Work on our data stack, including being the in-house expert on data scraping.
Run experiments to improve our revealed preference and simulation engines.
Work on infrastructure such as research tooling, CI/CD, and internal code review agents that scales our impact.
